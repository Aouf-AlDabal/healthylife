        <p class="lead">Obesity can cause a lot of damage to your body.
           People with severe obesity are more likely to have other diseases. 
           These include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and many more. Combined with obesity, these diseases may lead people to have a lower quality of health.
           In some cases, these can lead to disability or early death.</p>

        <h2>Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Obesity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes. People affected by obesity or severe obesity are about 10 times more likely to have type 2 diabetes. 
          Type 2 diabetes can nearly double the risk of death.
           Type 2 diabetes can lead to: 	Amputations •	Heart disease,Stroke,Blindness,Kidney disease,High blood pressure ,Circulatory and nerve defects,	Hard-to-heal infections,	Impotence and And more
           
        </p>
        <h2>Hypertension</h2>
        <p>
          Obesity is a major risk factor for high blood pressure (also known as “hypertension"). About 3 out of 4 hypertension cases are related to obesity. Hypertension increases the risk of other diseases.
           These include coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, and kidney disease.
        </p>
        <h2>Heart Disease</h2>
        <p>
                    Heart disease kills about 600,000 people every year in the United States. The American Heart Association considers obesity a major risk factor for heart disease. Large studies show that the risk for heart disease increases with obesity. People with severe obesity are at a higher risk for coronary artery disease. This means they have a higher risk of a heart attack.
          Obesity increases your risk of heart failure. Severe obesity is associated with irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). These arrhythmias can triple the risk of cardiac arrest. However, some excess weight can protect against dying from heart failure after the diagnosis is made.

        </p>
        <h2>Respiratory Disorders</h2>
        <p>
                    People with obesity have reduced lung capacity. These people are at higher risk for respiratory infections. They are more likely to have asthma and other respiratory disorders. Asthma has been shown to be three to four times more common among people with obesity.
          More than half of those affected by obesity (around 50-60 percent) have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) In cases of severe obesity, this figure is around 90 percent. OSA is a very serious breathing disorder. OSA occurs when excess fat in the neck, throat, and tongue block air passageways during sleep. This blockage causes apnea, which means a person stops breathing for a time. A person with OSA may have hundreds of apnea episodes each night. Apnea episodes reduce the amount of oxygen in a person’s blood. 
          OSA may lead to high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. OSA can cause sudden cardiac death and stroke. Because apnea episodes interrupt the normal sleep cycle, you may not reach restful sleep. This can lead to fatigue and drowsiness. If untreated, this drowsiness may raise your risk of motor vehicle accidents.

        </p>
        <h2>Cancer</h2>
        <p>Cancer affects more than half a million lives per year in the United States alone.
           Obesity is believed to cause up to 90,000 cancer deaths per year.
           As body mass index (BMI) increases, so does your risk of cancer and death from cancer</p>
          <h2>Cerebrovascular Disease and Stroke</h2>
          <p>Obesity puts a strain on your whole circulatory system. This strain increases your risk for stroke. Obesity can lead to other stroke risk factors. Stroke risk factors include heart disease, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
